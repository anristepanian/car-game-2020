## Legend About Racer Game

This is a racing game, that I've designed yet in 2020, and later used as my course project, that's why there is my name in the loading and credits scenes. The project was created by me in Unity, while functions were written in C#, all the models were created by me in Blender.

## How To Play

In order to play the game, the user has to maneuver with the car left or right using the keys _a_ and _d_ (or _left arrow_ and _right arrow_).<br>There are 3 levels of the game. Every single level is harder than the previous one.<br>In case of collision with the environment object, the level restarts! In order to save a progress, the user has to pass the level.<br> After the user has passed all 3 levels, he will observe the credits scene, congratulating him and telling that it was the end of a game!<br>
> [!NOTE]
> You can observe the [game process](game_process)

## Programs were used

- Unity engine
- Blender
- C#
- Microsoft visual studio

## Future Enhancements

It would be more interesting to play if the car's **physics** was better. Also it is needed adding more levels to prolong users' play time.

## Installation

Nothing else is needed to install.

## Usage

Run the [Legend_about_racer.exe](Legend_about_racer.exe) and play!
