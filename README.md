## Legend About Racer Game

This is a racing game that I designed in 2020 and later used as my course project. That's why my name is in the loading and credits scenes. I created the project in Unity, while functions were written in C#. All the models were created by me in Blender.

## How To Play

To play the game, the user has to maneuver with the car left or right using the keys _a_ and _d_ (or _left arrow_ and _right arrow_).<br>There are three levels, and every level is harder than the previous one.<br>In case of a collision with the environment object, the level restarts! To save progress, the user has to pass the level.<br> After the user completes all 3 levels, he will see a scene with credits congratulating him and informing him that this is the end of the game!<br>
> [!NOTE]
> You can observe the [game process](game_process)

## Programs were used

- Unity engine
- Blender
- C#
- Microsoft visual studio

## Future Enhancements

It would be more fun to play if the car **physics** were better. Also, more levels need to be added to extend the time users play.

## Installation

There is no need to install anything else.

## Usage

Run the [Legend_about_racer.exe](Legend_about_racer.exe) and play!
